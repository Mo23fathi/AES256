AES Encryption and Decryption Implementation
This Python script provides a basic implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for both encryption and decryption. AES is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm, chosen by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a standard for encryption.

Features
Supports AES encryption with key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
Implements both encryption and decryption processes.
Uses substitution box (S-box) for encryption and decryption operations.
Provides functions for key expansion, key scheduling, and round operations.
Includes implementations of the AES MixColumns and Inverse MixColumns operations.
Offers flexibility to work with various input data sizes.
